# Services

I have set up self-hosted free services in my homelab for several reasons. First, it allows me to learn and experiment with different technologies and tools. By setting up and maintaining these services myself, I gain practical experience and knowledge that I can apply to other projects.

Second, it gives me more control over my data and privacy. By self-hosting services such as Nextcloud for file storage and email, I can ensure that my data is stored locally and not on third-party servers. This gives me greater control over who has access to my data and how it is used.

Third, it is a cost-effective solution. By self-hosting services on my own hardware, I don't have to pay for expensive subscriptions or hosting fees. This allows me to experiment with different services without worrying about the cost.

Finally, it is a fun and rewarding hobby. Setting up and maintaining a homelab can be challenging at times, but it is also very satisfying to see the services I've set up running smoothly and efficiently. It is a great way to learn new skills and keep myself engaged in the world of technology.
