# Why this blog
---

<br/>
As a lover of all things cyberpunk, Linux, and technology, I was inspired to create this website to share my passion and knowledge with like-minded individuals around the world. I wanted to create a platform where I could write about the latest trends and advancements in the tech world, share my thoughts and ideas on cyberpunk culture, and provide tips and tutorials for those interested in Linux and other open-source software.


### Linux  
One of my main motivations for creating this website was to promote the use of Linux and other open-source software. I firmly believe that open-source software is the future of computing, as it allows for greater transparency, security, and flexibility than proprietary software. By sharing my knowledge and experiences with Linux and other open-source tools, I hope to encourage others to make the switch and experience the benefits of open-source software for themselves.


### Cyberpunk genre
Another source of inspiration for this website was the cyberpunk genre itself. Cyberpunk has always been a fascinating and influential movement in popular culture, and it has inspired countless works of fiction, art, and technology over the years. By exploring the themes and ideas of cyberpunk culture on this website, I hope to connect with other fans of the genre and share our mutual love for all things cyberpunk.


### Trends
Technology is also a major source of inspiration for this website. As someone who has always been interested in the latest gadgets and advancements in computing, I wanted to create a platform where I could write about the latest trends and innovations in the tech world. Whether it's the latest smartphone release or the newest development in artificial intelligence, I aim to provide insightful and engaging content that keeps readers up to date on the latest happenings in the tech industry.


### Community
In creating this website, I also hope to foster a sense of community among like-minded individuals who share my interests in cyberpunk, Linux, and technology. By providing a platform for discussion and collaboration, I aim to create a space where readers can connect with each other, share their own experiences and knowledge, and collaborate on projects and ideas related to our shared interests.

Overall, my goal with this website is to create a space where I can explore my passions for cyberpunk, Linux, and technology, while also connecting with others who share these interests. Whether you're a seasoned Linux user, a die-hard cyberpunk fan, or simply someone who loves technology and all its possibilities, I hope you'll find something to enjoy on this website, and that you'll join me on this journey of exploration and discovery.
