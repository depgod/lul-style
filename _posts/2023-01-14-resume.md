### Projects  
---
-> **Homelab**  
  September 2019 to today  

  Since August of 2019, I have been maintaining a homelab which hosts a few of my services which I cater to few people from my family and friends around 15 of them.  
  Services I am hosting:  
  1. Nextcloud - Google Workspace alternative  
  2. Bitwarden - Password Manager for all  
  3. Pihole - Selfhosted DNS and Adblocker  
  4. Portainer - For docker management  
  5. Nginx - Web hosting  
  6. CloudFlare tunnels - Secure reverse proxy that safely exposes my services to internet without port forwarding in my router  
  7. Wireguard - Selfhosted VPN  
  8. Proxmox - Awesome hypervisor that gives me unlimited virtual machines and containers  
  9. Service uptime alerts  
  10. MySQL server  

  Hardware I am using:  
  1. Two 6th gen intel powered laptops now turned into ubuntu servers  
  2. 100mbps D-link switch  
  3. Nokia G-240 Dual band router  
  4. Lan cables, various connectors    
  5. 1 Digitalocean droplet  for personal VPN  
  6. Master node  
  In the span of last 3 years I have managed these services with maximum uptime, on time server maintenance and managed logs counter actively. While managing these services there were scenarios when I learned about the importance of shell scripting for automated backups and server patching. My go to containerization solution is docker and lxc depending on the applicaion requirements.  

  **Please check out my public services:**  
  1. ![Next Coud](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next%20Cloud-0B94DE?style=for-the-badge&logo=nextcloud&logoColor=white) -> [üîó](https://nc.shellshock.lol) _(sign up's now closed because of abuse)_
