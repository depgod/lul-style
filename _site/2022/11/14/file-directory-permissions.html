<p>Understanding read, write and executable permissions.</p>

<p>If we do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -l</code>:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>.rw-rw-r-- user family 168 B  Sun Nov 13 01:59:08 2022 things.txt
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Here as we can see a dot “.” at the head part of the output line shows that this is a regular file.</p>

<p>When going through permissions there are four parts of it which can be seen in form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drwx-rw-r--</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./Linux-File-Permissions-2.webp" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>r –&gt; Read permission<br />
w –&gt; Write permission<br />
x –&gt; Executing permission<br />
“-“ –&gt; No permission</p>

<h3 id="how-permissions-are-evaluated">How permissions are evaluated</h3>

<p>When a user tries to read or write to a file, the users permisisons are evaluated in a linear left to right manner:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First owner permissions will be looked at and action will be taken based on its permissions.</li>
  <li>If the owner has none of the required permissions then group permissions will be looked at and action is taken accordingly.</li>
  <li>Lastly if the user is not int he group or does not exist then last set of permissions will be looked at and action is taken accordingly.</li>
</ol>
