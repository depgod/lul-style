<p>ZeroTier and Tailscale are two popular software-defined networking (SDN) solutions that provide secure and flexible networking options for businesses and individuals. While both platforms offer similar functionality, there are some key differences that make ZeroTier a better choice for certain use cases.</p>

<h3 id="opensource-nature">Opensource nature</h3>
<p>One of the main advantages of ZeroTier is its open-source nature. Unlike Tailscale, which is a closed-source commercial product, ZeroTier is fully open-source, which means users have complete control over the code and can modify it to meet their specific needs. This also means that ZeroTier is free to use for most personal and non-commercial purposes, making it a more cost-effective option for individuals and small businesses.</p>

<h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
<p>Another key advantage of ZeroTier is its support for a wider range of platforms and devices. While Tailscale only works with a limited number of operating systems and devices, including Linux, macOS, Windows, and iOS, ZeroTier supports a much wider range of platforms, including Android, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and even some IoT devices. This makes ZeroTier a more versatile solution for organizations that need to connect devices running on different operating systems and platforms.</p>

<h3 id="flexible-and-scalable">Flexible and Scalable</h3>
<p>In addition to its broad platform support, ZeroTier also offers a more flexible and scalable networking architecture. Unlike Tailscale, which relies on a centralized server for routing and management, ZeroTier uses a distributed network architecture, where each node acts as a peer in the network and can route traffic to other nodes. This allows for greater redundancy and fault tolerance, as there is no single point of failure in the network. It also makes it easier to scale the network as new nodes can be added easily without requiring any central configuration.</p>

<h3 id="vlans">VLAN’s</h3>
<p>Another advantage of ZeroTier is its support for virtual LANs (VLANs), which allow users to segment the network and control access to different resources. This is especially useful for organizations that need to provide secure access to different departments or teams within the company. Tailscale, on the other hand, does not support VLANs, which means users have limited control over network segmentation and access control.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, ZeroTier offers a more customizable and extensible platform than Tailscale. Because it is open-source, users can modify the code to add new features or integrate it with other tools and services. This makes it a more adaptable solution for organizations that have specific requirements or need to integrate with other systems.</p>

<p>While Tailscale has its advantages, including a user-friendly interface and ease of use, ZeroTier is a more versatile and customizable solution that offers greater flexibility, scalability, and control. For individuals and small businesses, ZeroTier is a more cost-effective option that provides access to a wide range of platforms and devices, while for larger organizations that need to scale their networks and control access to different resources, ZeroTier’s distributed architecture and support for VLANs make it a better choice.</p>
